JavaScript Strings

JavaScript strings are for storing and manipulating text.A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

let text = "abc";

You can use single or double quotes:
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes

You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:
let answer1 = "It's alright";
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

String Length
To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:

Example
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;

let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
let text = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
let text= 'It\'s alright.';
let text = "The character \\ is called backslash.";

Breaking Long Code Lines
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
You can also break up a code line within a text string with a single backslash:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello \
Dolly!";
The \ method is not the preferred method. It might not have universal support.
Some browsers do not allow spaces behind the \ character.

A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition:
JavaScript Strings as Objects
Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:

let x = "John";
But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword new:

let y = new String("John");
Example
let x = "John";
let y = new String("John");
Do not create Strings objects.

The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.

String objects can produce unexpected results:

When using the == operator, x and y are equal:

let x = "John";
let y = new String("John");
When using the === operator, x and y are not equal:

let x = "John";
let y = new String("John");
Note the difference between (x==y) and (x===y).

(x == y) true or false?

let x = new String("John");
let y = new String("John");
(x === y) true or false?

let x = new String("John");
let y = new String("John");
Comparing two JavaScript objects always returns false.
Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello " +
"Dolly!";
You cannot break up a code line with a backslash:

Example
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = \
"Hello Dolly!";
